dataStatement       This Jun. 2022 monthly temperature max map of Honolulu County (Oahu) is a high spatial resolution gridded prediction of max temperature in degrees Celsius for the month Jun. 2022. This was produced using a piece-wise linear regression model regressed on elevation with the junction point at 2150 meters. The model was trained on 24 unique station location(s) within Honolulu County (Oahu). A leave one out cross validation (LOOCV) of the station data used in this map produced an R-squared of: 0.1416. All maps are subject to change as new data becomes available or unknown errors are corrected in reoccurring versions. Errors in temperature estimates do vary over space meaning any gridded temperature value, even on higher quality maps, could still produce incorrect estimates. Check standard error (SE) maps to better understand spatial estimates of prediction error
