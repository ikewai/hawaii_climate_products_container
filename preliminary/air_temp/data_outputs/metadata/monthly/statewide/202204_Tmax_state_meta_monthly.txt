dataStatement       This Apr. 2022 mosaic temperature map of the State of Hawaii is a high spatial resolution (~250m) gridded prediction of maximum temperature in degrees Celsius. This was produced using a piece-wise linear regression model using elevation (m) as its predictor(s). This process was done for four individually produced maps of Kauai, Honolulu (Oahu), Maui (Maui, Lanai, Molokai, & Kahoolawe) and Hawaii counties. The linear regression fitting used 79 unique station locations statewide and their Apr. 2022 recorded and/or estimated maximum temperatures (degC). Please consult each county map meta-data files for more details on map production and accuracy at the county scale. A leave one out cross validation (LOOCV) of the all station data used in all four counties produced individual R-squared values of: 0.92, 0.54, 0.89, 0.51 for Hawaii, Kauai, Maui (Maui, Lanai, Molokai, & Kahoolawe), and Honolulu (Oahu) counties respectively. As a whole leave one out cross validation (LOOCV) data from all stations data compared to observed monthly temperature (degC) produces a statewide R-squared value of: 0.88 meaning overall this Apr. 2022 statewide mosaic monthly maximum temperature map is a high quality estimate of monthly temperature. All maps are subject to change as new data becomes available or unknown errors are corrected in reoccurring versions. Errors in maximum temperature estimates do vary over space meaning any gridded temperature value, even on higher quality maps, could still produce incorrect estimates. Check standard error (SE) maps to better understand spatial estimates of prediction error.
