dataStatement       This Dec. 19, 2021 mosaic temperature map of the State of Hawaii is a high spatial resolution (~250m) gridded prediction of mean temperature in degrees Celsius. This was produced using a piece-wise linear regression model using elevation (m) as its predictor(s). This process was done for four individually produced maps of Kauai, Honolulu (Oahu), Maui (Maui, Lanai, Molokai, & Kahoolawe) and Hawaii counties. The linear regression fitting used 45 unique station locations statewide and their Dec. 19, 2021 recorded and/or estimated mean temperatures (degC). Please consult each county map meta-data files for more details on map production and accuracy at the county scale. A leave one out cross validation (LOOCV) of the all station data used in all four counties produced individual R-squared values of: 0.99, nan, 0.99, 0.94 for Hawaii, Kauai, Maui (Maui, Lanai, Molokai, & Kahoolawe), and Honolulu (Oahu) counties respectively. As a whole leave one out cross validation (LOOCV) data from all stations data compared to observed daily temperature (degC) produces a statewide R-squared value of: 0.98 meaning overall this Dec. 19, 2021 statewide mosaic daily mean temperature map is a high quality estimate of daily temperature. All maps are subject to change as new data becomes available or unknown errors are corrected in reoccurring versions. Errors in mean temperature estimates do vary over space meaning any gridded temperature value, even on higher quality maps, could still produce incorrect estimates. Check standard error (SE) maps to better understand spatial estimates of prediction error.
