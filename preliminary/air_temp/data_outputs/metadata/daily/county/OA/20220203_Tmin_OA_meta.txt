dataStatement       This Feb. 03, 2022 daily temperature minimum map of Honolulu County (Oahu) is a high spatial resolution gridded prediction of minimum temperature in degrees Celsius for the date Feb. 03, 2022. This was produced using a piece-wise linear regression model regressed on elevation with the junction point at 2150 meters. The model was trained on 11 unique station location(s) within Honolulu County (Oahu). A leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) was performed based on the station data available for the target island. However, the R-squared value is negative. If outer island data were used to supplement the model training, R-squared may not accurately represent goodness of fit. Please consult the cross-validation table or the standard error maps for more information on model error. All maps are subject to change as new data becomes available or unknown errors are corrected in reoccurring versions. Errors in temperature estimates do vary over space meaning any gridded temperature value, even on higher quality maps, could still produce incorrect estimates. Check standard error (SE) maps to better understand spatial estimates of prediction error
