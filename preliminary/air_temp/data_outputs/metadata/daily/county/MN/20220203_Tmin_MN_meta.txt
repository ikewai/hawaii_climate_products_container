dataStatement       This Feb. 03, 2022 daily temperature minimum map of Maui County (Maui, Lanai, Molokai, Kahoolawe) is a high spatial resolution gridded prediction of minimum temperature in degrees Celsius for the date Feb. 03, 2022. This was produced using a piece-wise linear regression model regressed on elevation with the junction point at 2150 meters. The model was trained on 8 unique station location(s) within Maui County (Maui, Lanai, Molokai, Kahoolawe). Due to limited station availability, the model training was supplemented by 1 station(s) from Big Island. A leave one out cross validation (LOOCV) of the station data used in this map produced an R-squared of: 0.9082. All maps are subject to change as new data becomes available or unknown errors are corrected in reoccurring versions. Errors in temperature estimates do vary over space meaning any gridded temperature value, even on higher quality maps, could still produce incorrect estimates. Check standard error (SE) maps to better understand spatial estimates of prediction error
