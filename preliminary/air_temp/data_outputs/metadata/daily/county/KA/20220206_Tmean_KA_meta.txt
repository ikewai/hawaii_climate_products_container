dataStatement       This Feb. 06, 2022 daily temperature mean map of Kauai County is a high spatial resolution gridded prediction of mean temperature in degrees Celsius for the date Feb. 06, 2022. This was produced using a piece-wise linear regression model regressed on elevation with the junction point at 2150 meters. The model was trained on 18 unique station location(s) within Kauai County. Due to limited station availability, the model training was supplemented by 12 station(s) from Oahu. Insufficient validation stations were available for the target island. Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) could not be performed and R-squared value is nan. All maps are subject to change as new data becomes available or unknown errors are corrected in reoccurring versions. Errors in temperature estimates do vary over space meaning any gridded temperature value, even on higher quality maps, could still produce incorrect estimates. Check standard error (SE) maps to better understand spatial estimates of prediction error
