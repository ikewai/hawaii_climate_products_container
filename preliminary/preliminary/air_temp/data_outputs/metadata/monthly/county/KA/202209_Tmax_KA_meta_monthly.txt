dataStatement       This Sep. 2022 monthly temperature max map of Kauai County is a high spatial resolution gridded prediction of max temperature in degrees Celsius for the month Sep. 2022. This was produced using a piece-wise linear regression model regressed on elevation with the junction point at 2150 meters. The model was trained on 11 unique station location(s) within Kauai County. A leave one out cross validation (LOOCV) of the station data used in this map produced an R-squared of: 0.9462. All maps are subject to change as new data becomes available or unknown errors are corrected in reoccurring versions. Errors in temperature estimates do vary over space meaning any gridded temperature value, even on higher quality maps, could still produce incorrect estimates. Check standard error (SE) maps to better understand spatial estimates of prediction error
